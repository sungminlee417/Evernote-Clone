## About the Evernote Clone

This Evernote clone is a PERN stack application using React/Redux for the frontend, and Express/PostgresSQL for the backend. This app allows users to create notes/notebooks. Users also have the ability to edit their notes/notebooks as long as the changes pass validations listed on the backend.
